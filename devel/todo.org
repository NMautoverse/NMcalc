** means
*** how to append in dt?
##' @details
##' means return a data.frame which makes it easy to integrate with
##' data.table. But it's a little complicated if you want more than
##' the means results. This works:
##' dt[,append(means(DV,ci=TRUE),list(N=.N))]
** DONE logit and invlogit
logit <- function(x) log(x/(1-x))
invlogit <- function(x) 1/(1+exp(-x))
** signif2
*** TODO Handle NA's explicitly.
Returns a string " NA". Would be better to return <NA> and add an
option to insert something else (like "-")
